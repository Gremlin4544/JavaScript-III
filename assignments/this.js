/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding defaults the function to the object unless it is in strict mode which will stop the binding from breaking the code and will result in undefined
* 2. Implicit binding is used 80% of the time in objects with methods and it refers to the object to the left of the dot "." when it is invoked.
* 3. Explicit binding uses the .call, .bind and .apply tp pass arguments and will explicity state which keyword that this is being applied to i.e. .call(info). 
* 4. New binding uses a new keyword in the constructor function to "construct" a new object and this will point to the new object.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
